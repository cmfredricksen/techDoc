                <h3>Initializing Git to start tracking your files.</h3>

                <p>Git is version control software. It keeps track of every change you make to your files. This allows you the freedom to go back to an earlier rendition of your code if things go awry. Another handy feature is the ability to work on branches, only merging to your main project once everything is working properly.</p>
                <p>In order for Git to track your changes you need to start a repository for your project directory. After you create your directory, then use the 'git init' command in your terminal. (Instructions below) Git init is short for git initialize, and this command begins a repository for your project directory.
                </p>
                <p>Once you have initialized your git repository, then any files or other assets you add to the directory will be added to the list of items to be saved when you commit. You can prevent certain things from being added if you want.</p>
                <p>To start you need to open your command prompt, powershell, or terminal. Once you have opened your prompt, navigate to the directory (folder) you want to track using git. Next type in the following command and hit enter:</p>
                
                <p class='code-box'>git init</p class='code-box'>
        

                <p>Now your directory is being tracked by git, and this repository that you just created will record all of the changes you make to your code.</p>

                <p>I am using Visual Studio Code, which has a built in terminal. If you have your folder open and open a new terminal in VSC it will already be in the current directory. There are also tools you can use for git in VSC that do not require using the terminal.</p>

                <p>Whether you use the terminal, or the tools in your editor to work with Git, the steps are the same and proceed in the same order. I suggest learning how to use the terminal first, but you can do it either way.</p>

                <p>Now you have initialized a git repository to keep track of your files, what's next?</p>

                <h3>Staging your changes so you can save, or commit them.</h3>
                <p>You have done some work on your project and now you want to save it, along with each change you've made along the way. In Git, a save is called a commit, and before you make a 'commit' you have to 'stage' your changes.</p>
                <p>Here is how to do it, return to your command prompt and type in the following:</p>
        

                <p class='code-box'>git status</p class='code-box'>

                <p>This will get you a list of files and other assets from your directory that need to be staged in red, and those already staged in green.</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git add filename</p class='code-box'>
            
                <p>'filename' means the name of your file, for example index.html. </p>
            
            
            
                <P>If you have changes across several files within your directory you can simply type in:</P>
            
                
                <p class='code-box'>git add .</p class='code-box'>
            
                <p>This will add all of the files in the current directory that have changes to the staging area. Now that the files are staged, they are ready to commit.You can check you git status agin and you will see everything that is staged is now colored green, which means it is ready to commit.</p>

           <section class="main-section" id="committing">
        
                <h3>Saving your changes, which is called committing in Git.</h3>
                <p>Now your files are staged and ready to save. To do this you use the 'git commit' command. When you use 'git commit' you are also required to add a message about the changes. You do this by appending the message tag(-m) followed by the message to your commit command:</p> 
            
                <p class='code-box'> -m "message about changes"</p class='code-box'>

                <p>The full command is written below:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git commit filename -m "message about changes"</p class='code-box'>
        
                <p>Your message is about the changes you have made to your code since the last commit. Normally once your files are made, you do an initial commit and the message is just "initial commit" This is before you add any code, or maybe once you add the very basic bits.</p>
                <p>Normally the advice is too commit often. It makes it easier to find code that is causing problems, or go back before unwanted changes were made. Each commit is a record of every change you made to every file included in that commit. Just something to keep in mind.</p>
        
                <p>Just like staging, you can also use the ' . ' to include all files that are staged to commit. Once you commit, your latest version is saved to your repository. Your previous versions are also saved, so you can go back to them if needed or desired. But what if you want to share them, maybe even collaborate with others? That's what GitHub is for.</p>

           <section class="main-section" id="github">
                <h3>Github basics, including how to create an account and how start a repository.</h3>
                <p>GitHub is a server that allows you to store your changes in remote repositories. This is a wonderful tool, as you have access to your work from any computer that is hooked to the internet AND you can collaborate with others very easily while working on code.</p>
                <p>GitHub is free to use, simply go to:</p>
                 <a class='text-link' href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> 
                 <p>and sign up for a free account. Once you are signed up follow these steps:</p>
                 <ol>

                     <li>Navigate to your account page</li>
                     <li>Click on the Repositories tab.</li>
                     <li>Click on 'NEW' button to creat a repository.</li>
                     <li>Do Not initialize with a README file for this repository.</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>Now that you have created your remote repository, open your command line, navigate to your projects directory, and type in the following commands:</p>

                <p class='code-box'>git remote add origin url-of-repository</p class='code-box'>
        
                <p>To find the URL of your repository, simply navigate to that repo's page on GitHub. Then you can copy the address by clicking on the 'clone' button. You can also copy the address from the adress bar on your web browser while on the repo's page.</p>
                <p>Now your local repository is connected to your remote repository. Next we will push our changes to GitHub.</p>
                <a href="#top"><p  class="symbol">back to top</p></a>
        
        
            </section>
        
           <section class="main-section" id="pushing">
                <h3>How to push your changes to an online repository, namely Github.</h3>
                <p>Next we are going to push our changes to GitHub, saving them in our remote repository that we just created. The first time you push a commit you will type in this command:</p>
        
                <p class='code-box'>git push origin master</p class='code-box'>

                <p>The above is for the first time push on any new repository. Once you have pushed commits to your remote repo for the first time the rest of your pushes are done using:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git push</p class='code-box'>
                <p>Now your files, and all of the changes made are saved to Github where you can work on them, share them and allow collaboration, just to name a few things. Once you have this set up, it is very quick and simple to keep everything up to date and in synch. To Summarize:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git add filename</p class='code-box'><br>
                <p class='code-box'>git commit filename -m "message about changes"</p class='code-box'><br>
                <p class='code-box'>git push</p class='code-box'>
                <p>That's all for basic use of Git and GitHub, there is a lot more you can do with these amazing tools. Don't be intimidated, you will get the hang of it. The following sections are just extra tidbits I am still learning, you might find them useful.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="branches">
                <h3>How to use branches while working on your project. This includes creating branches, switching branches, and merging branches.</h3>
                <p>Branches allow you to work on, or add special features, without interfering with your current project. When you start a repository in Git, it is automatically assigned to the role of 'Master' branch. </p>
                <p>I often make another branch to work on the layout while I am building my site. I call it layout. Once I am pleased with my work I merge it with the 'Master' branch.</p>
                <p>To start in your terminal type in:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git branch</p class='code-box'>
                <p>This will give you a list of current branches in your project. The branch you are currently working on will be highlighted. To make a new branch:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git branch name-of-new-branch</p class='code-box'>
                <p>Then to switch over to your new branch type in:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git checkout name-of-new-branch</p class='code-box'>
                <p>Now you are working on your new branch. Once you have made some changes you go through the same process of:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git add filename</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git commit filename -m "message about changes"</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git push</p>
                <p>If it is your first time pushing this branch to your remote repository then use:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git push origin name-of-new-branch</p class='code-box'>
                <p>Once you are finished pushing your changes to GitHub, then you can switch back to Master by typing in:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git checkout master</p class='code-box'>
                <p>Once you have switched to the master branch, you can then merge your other branch to master by typing in:</p>
                <p class='code-box'>git merge name-of-new-branch</p class='code-box'>
                <p>Now you have merged your changes from your other branch in with the master.</p>
                <p>This is just a little bit of basic information, things I have had to look up quite a bit until I got it down pat. There is a lot more to explore with Git and GitHub.</p>

                <h3>How to Deploy Your Site Using Git Pages</h3>
                <p>This, to me, was one of the trickiest things to figure out as a beginner to coding and web development. So I learned to follow the steps which I found on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and after I had those down I was able to understand it better.</p>
                <p>Once you have pushed your repo to GitHub, then you can publish the page to the web using GitHub Pages. You must have an index.html file to do this.</p>
                <p>Follow these steps:</p>
                <li>On GitHub, navigate to the repo you want to publish</li>
                <li>Click on Settings</li>
                <li>On the settings page, click on Pages in the left menu</li>
                <li>Under Source change it to Master</li>
                <li>Click Save</li>
                <p>And that is it, your website is now online and you can view it by clicking the link where it says 'Your site is ready to be published link_to_site'. You can share this link with anyone you want so they can visit your site too.</p>
                <p>As a note: It may take a few minutes for your site to go live!</p>
                <p>Another thing you can do is go back to your repo's page and go to the About settings, add the link to your website there and it will show up on your repo. Very nifty!</p>
                <p>This is just the beginning of what you can do with GitHub pages, but I am just giving you the basic info needed to publish your site, and it's free!</p>

                <h3>More information including definitions, tips and tricks and resources for learning.</h3>
                <p>There are several sources of good information on Git and GitHub, but the best way to learn is by doing. When I started trying to learn about version control it was hard for me to wrap my head around it. So the first source I am going to share is a series of YouTube videos by The Coding Train that helped me understand it a little better, while keeping it fun.</p>

                <h3>About this Page</h3>
                <p>This page is based on my own notes while I was learning how to use Git & GitHub. </p>
                <p>In order to learn, I practiced the steps over and over again. I made a new project folder, and then initiated git, then I made my online repo and connected it to my local one. I tried to make regular commits and push them to my online repo, though I was inconsistent as a beginner. I went through the steps several times until it became pretty easy. After that I moved to branches, followed by GitHub pages. I did not need to do all of these things at the time, it was just practicing to get the muscle memory going. </p>
                <p>I hope this is useful for you. Don't give up, you'll get it!</p>
