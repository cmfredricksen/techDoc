# Git & Github

### A Beginners Guide

\
This is to help you when you are just getting started with coding and are unfamiliar with Version Control. It is simply my own notes which I turned into a small website, in order to help me remember these things. Maybe it will help you too.

I have some recommended sources that I found helpful as a beginner. The one that really helped me at the start was:
[Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) by The Coding Train YouTube channel.

I did work along with the teacher for everything. I learn best by doing, and then practicing over and over again until it sticks.

Next, I made sure to initialize git on every project, and then connect it to my online repository at GitHub. I worked to get into the habit of committing often and then making good descriptions of what I was committing in the message. The messages are for you, so that when you go back you can easily find what you are looking for.

Later I had to go and delete some of those GitHub repos because they were just experiments for learning. Some of them are probably still there waiting to be deleted, but it was worth it because I did learn how Version control operates on a basic level.
