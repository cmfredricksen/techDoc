# Git & Github

### A Beginners Guide

This is to help you when you are just getting started with coding and are unfamiliar with Version Control. It is simply my own notes which I turned into a small website, in order to help me remember these things. Maybe it will help you too.

I have some recommended sources that I found helpful on the site.

I made this page well over one year ago, and now I am re-doing the html and css.
